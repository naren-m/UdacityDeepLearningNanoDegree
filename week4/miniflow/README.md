### Backpropogation

#### Pre-requisites

Below we're getting into the math behind backpropagation which requires multivariable calculus. If you need a refresher, I highly recommend checking out

- [Khan Academy's lessons on partial derivatives](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/partial-derivatives/v/partial-derivatives-introduction)
- [Another video on gradients](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/multivariable-derivatives/gradient-and-directional-derivatives/v/gradient)
- [And finally, using the chain rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/product-quotient-chain-rules-ab/chain-rule-ab/v/chain-rule-introduction)
