### Model Evaluation and Validation

In the bike sharing project, the data was split into training, validation, and test sets. In this section we'll learn why this is needed, and how to find out how well your model is doing, and score it. In particular, you will cover:

- How to create a test set for your models.
- How to use confusion matrices to evaluate false positives, and false negatives.
- How to measure accuracy and other model metrics.
- How to evaluate regression.
- How to detect whether you are overfitting or underfitting based on the complexity of your model.
- How to use cross validation to ensure your model is generalizable.

Regression and Classification 

    Regression returns numeric value

    Classification returns a state

How do we find a model that generalizes well?

    To do this we
